      Bookmark links, also known as anchor links, are links that allow you to
      jump to a specific section on a page. To create a bookmark link, you'll
      need to define the target section with a unique ID, and then create a link
      that points to that ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, here's a link to the
      <a href="#section2">second section</a> on this page:
    </p>
    <h2 id="section2">Second Section</h2>
    <p>
      This is the second section on the page. When you click on the link in the
      first section, you'll jump directly to this section.
    </p>
